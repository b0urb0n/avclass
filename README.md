# AVClass

AVClass is a Python package / command line tool to tag / label malware samples. 
You input the AV labels for a large number of malware samples (e.g., VirusTotal JSON reports) 
and it outputs tags extracted from the AV labels of each sample. 
AVClass will output the family names, along with other tags capturing the malware class (e.g., *worm*, *ransomware*, *grayware*), behaviors (e.g., *spam*, *ddos*), and file properties (e.g., *packed*, *themida*, *bundle*, *nsis*). 
It can also be run in compatibility mode `-c` (AVClass 1.x) to only output the family names (i.e., family tags). 
It can also output a ranking of all alternative family names it found for each sample.


A quick example helps illustrating the differences of compatibility mode. If you run AVClass on our example input file:

```shell
$ python3 ./avclass/labeler.py -i ./examples/malheurReference_lb.json -t lb -p
```

the output on stdout is:

```
aca2d12934935b070df8f50e06a20539 33 CLASS:grayware|10,CLASS:grayware:adware|9,FILE:os:windows|8,FAM:adrotator|8,CLASS:downloader|3,FAM:zlob|2
67d15459e1f85898851148511c86d88d 37 CLASS:dialer|23,FILE:os:windows|9,FAM:adultbrowser|8,CLASS:dialer:porndialer|7,CLASS:grayware|6,CLASS:grayware:tool|3,FAM:target|2
```
which means sample *aca2d12934935b070df8f50e06a20539* 
was flagged by 33 AV engines and 10 of them agree it is *grayware*, 9 that it is more specifically *adware*, 
8 mention that it runs on *windows*, another 8 that it is the *adrotator* family, 
3 that it is a *downloader*, and 2 that it belongs instead to the *zlob* family.
Sample *67d15459e1f85898851148511c86d88d* is flagged by 37 AV engines and 23 of them 
consider it a *dialer*, 8 that it belongs to the *adultbrowser* family, and so on.

If you instead run AVClass on the same input file in compatibility mode:

```shell
$ python3 ./avclass/labeler.py -i ./examples/malheurReference_lb.json -t lb -c
```

the output looks like this, which simply reports the most common family name for each sample.

```
aca2d12934935b070df8f50e06a20539 adrotator
67d15459e1f85898851148511c86d88d adultbrowser
``` 


The output can also be formatted as **JSON**.
```shell
$ python3 ./avclass/labeler.py -i ./examples/malheurReference_lb.json -t lb -p -json
```
the output on stdout is:

```json
{
  "labels": [
    {
      "hash": "aca2d12934935b070df8f50e06a20539",
      "av_count": 33,
      "tags": [
        {
          "tag": "grayware",
          "count": 9,
          "category": "CLASS",
          "path": "CLASS:grayware"
        },
        {
          "tag": "adware",
          "count": 9,
          "category": "CLASS",
          "path": "CLASS:grayware:adware"
        },
        {
          "tag": "windows",
          "count": 8,
          "category": "FILE",
          "path": "FILE:os:windows"
        },
        {
          "tag": "adrotator",
          "count": 8,
          "category": "FAM",
          "path": "FAM:adrotator"
        },
        {
          "tag": "execdownload",
          "count": 3,
          "category": "BEH",
          "path": "BEH:execdownload"
        },
        {
          "tag": "downloader",
          "count": 3,
          "category": "CLASS",
          "path": "CLASS:downloader"
        },
        {
          "tag": "zlob",
          "count": 2,
          "category": "FAM",
          "path": "FAM:zlob"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Or it can be used as a Python package:
```py
import json
from avclass.labeler import AVClassLabeler

av_class = AVClassLabeler()
result = av_class.run(
    files="./examples/malheurReference_lb.json",
    data_type="lb",
    path_export=True,
)
print(json.dumps(result))
```
the output on stdout is:

```json
{
  "labels": [
    {
      "hash": "aca2d12934935b070df8f50e06a20539",
      "av_count": 33,
      "tags": [
        {
          "tag": "grayware",
          "count": 9,
          "category": "CLASS",
          "path": "CLASS:grayware"
        },
        {
          "tag": "adware",
          "count": 9,
          "category": "CLASS",
          "path": "CLASS:grayware:adware"
        },
        {
          "tag": "windows",
          "count": 8,
          "category": "FILE",
          "path": "FILE:os:windows"
        },
        {
          "tag": "adrotator",
          "count": 8,
          "category": "FAM",
          "path": "FAM:adrotator"
        },
        {
          "tag": "execdownload",
          "count": 3,
          "category": "BEH",
          "path": "BEH:execdownload"
        },
        {
          "tag": "downloader",
          "count": 3,
          "category": "CLASS",

        {
          "tag": "zlob",
          "count": 2,
          "category": "FAM",
          "path": "FAM:zlob"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

In proceedings of the Annual Computer Security Applications Conference, December 2020.

## Why is AVClass useful?

Because a lot of times security researchers want to extract family and other 
information from AV labels, but this process is not as simple as it looks, 
especially if you need to do it for large numbers (e.g., millions) of samples. 
Some advantages of AVClass are:

1. *Automatic.* They remove manual analysis limitations on the size of the 
input dataset.

2. *Vendor-agnostic.* They operate on the labels of any available set of AV 
engines, which can vary from sample to sample.

3. *Cross-platform.* They can be used for any platforms supported by AV 
engines, e.g., Windows or Android malware.

4. *Does not require executables.* AV labels can be obtained from online services
 like VirusTotal using a sample's hash, even when the executable is not available.

5. *Quantified accuracy.* We have evaluated AVClass 2.x on millions of 
samples and publicly available malware datasets with ground truth. 
Evaluation details are in the RAID 2016 and ACSAC 2020 papers.

6. *Open source.* The code is available and we are happy to incorporate 
suggestions and improvements so that the security community benefits from 
these tools.

## Limitations

The main limitations of AVClass is that the output depends 
on the input AV labels. 
The tool tries to compensate for the noise on the AV labels, 
but cannot identify tags if AV engines do not provide non-generic tokens 
in the labels of a sample. 
In particular, it cannot tag samples if at least 2 AV engines 
do not agree on a tag. 

Still, there are many samples that it can tag
and thus we believe you will find it useful.
We recommend you to read the RAID 2016 and ACSAC 2020 papers for more details.

## Input JSON format

AVClass supports four input JSON formats: 

1. VirusTotal v2 API JSON reports (*-vt file*), 
where each line in the input *file* should be the full JSON of a 
VirusTotal v2 API response to the */file/report* endpoint,
e.g., obtained by querying https://www.virustotal.com/vtapi/v2/file/report?apikey={apikey}&resource={hash}
There is an example VirusTotal v2 input file in examples/vtv2_sample.json

```shell
$./avclass/labeler.py -i examples/vtv2_sample.json -t vt2 -p > output.txt
```

2. VirusTotal v3 API JSON reports (*-vt file -vt3*), 
where each line in the input *file* should be the full JSON of a VirusTotal API version 3 response with a *File* object report, 
e.g., obtained by querying https://www.virustotal.com/api/v3/files/{hash}
There is an example VirusTotal v3 input file in examples/vtv3_sample.json

```shell
$./avclass/labeler.py -i examples/vtv3_sample.json -p -t vt3 > output.txt
```

3. Simplified JSON (*-lb file*),
where each line in *file* should be a JSON 
with (at least) these fields:
{md5, sha1, sha256, av_labels}. 
There is an example of such input file in *examples/malheurReference_lb.json*

```shell
$./avclass/labeler.py -i examples/malheurReference_lb.json -t lb -p > output.txt
```

4. Metadefender JSON (*-md file*),
where each line in *file* should be a JSON

```shell
$./avclass/labeler.py -i examples/malheurReference_lb.json -t md -p > output.txt
```

**Why have a simplified JSON format?**

We believe most users will get the AV labels using VirusTotal. 
However, AVClass is IO-bound and a VirusTotal report 
in addition to the AV labels and hashes includes 
a lot of other data that the tools do not need. 
Thus, when applying AVClass to millions of samples,
reducing the input file size by removing unnnecessary data 
significantly improves efficiency. 
Furthermore, users could obtain AV labels from other sources and 
the simpler the input JSON format, 
the easier to convert those AV labels into an input file.

## Dependencies

AVClass is both written in Python. 
It should be run on Python versions >= 3.6.

They do not require installing any dependencies.
